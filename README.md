# IMDB Data Cleaning

Transforming the NA values of the IMDB dataset to functional data points, making the dataset suitable for analysis. Written in Jupyter Notebooks using Pandas and Python's built-in functions for data cleaning.

## Features

- Utilizes Pandas to import data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Utilizes multiple Pandas functions and Python methods to clean the data.
- Uses cleaning strategies that lessen data loss and deletion while still providing accuracy.
- Exports the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file for further preprocessing and analysis.

## Description

Cleaning a dataset is perhaps the most important step in the data analysis process. Most datasets in the real world are going to have errors, incorrect data types, and irrelevant data. This was the case for the IMDB dataset that I used in this project. It's a great dataset filled with excellent information, but it was unusable for meaningful analysis in its original state. By removing useless data, transforming NA values, and converting certain columns to different data types, I was able to produce a much more suitable dataset that can be used for future analysis. The cleaning was also done using techniques to minimize data deletion while still providing accurate data for filling NA values.
